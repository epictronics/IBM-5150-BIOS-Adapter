# IBM-5150-BIOS-Adapter
EPROM adapter that fits in a 5150 instead of the original BIOS ROM
Many EPROM adapters won't work as a BIOS replacement in the IBM PC 5150 because they sit too close to the floppy drive.
I designed these adapters to fit specifically in the 5150 but they will of course work in many other vintage computers.
Uploaded Gerber files have been tested with PCBs I ordered from PCBWay.
These adapters will take a standard 2764, 27128, 27256 or 27512 EPROM.
BOM list: 1 EPROM, 1 socket for the EPROM, two rows of machined pin headers, 10k resistors, and 0 ohm resistors.
